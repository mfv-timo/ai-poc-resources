Innovating with AI: MoneyForward Vietnam’s AI Hackathon 2025 Ignites Creativity and Efficiency

On August 15, 2025, MoneyForward Vietnam hosted one of its most anticipated internal technology events of the year: the AI Hackathon 2025. This competition brought together approximately 75 talented members from across the company, uniting engineers, product managers, designers, and AI enthusiasts under one ambitious theme: leveraging AI tools and platforms to enhance software products or improve work efficiency.

This event served as a dynamic platform for innovation, showcasing how artificial intelligence can accelerate digital transformation and empower employees to reimagine the future of MoneyForward’s software solutions.

Purpose and Vision of the Hackathon
The financial technology landscape is evolving rapidly, and MoneyForward is at the forefront of delivering innovative solutions for both individuals and businesses. Recognizing the transformative power of AI, MoneyForward Vietnam organized this hackathon to encourage employees to explore real-world AI applications.

The core objectives of the AI Hackathon 2025 included:

Encouraging cross-functional collaboration among employees to experiment with AI-driven features.

Identifying opportunities to integrate AI tools and platforms into existing MoneyForward products.

Enhancing operational efficiency by automating processes or improving decision-making with data-driven AI systems.

Fostering a culture of innovation, where creative thinking and technological advancement thrive together.

The Event Structure
The AI Hackathon was designed as a one-day sprint where 6 solo-teams and 16 teams (total 75 members) competed for top honors. Each team was given the freedom to choose its own project idea, as long as it aligned with the central theme of AI application.

Morning Session: Kick-off and Brainstorming
The event started with opening remarks from the MoneyForward Vietnam leadership team, highlighting the importance of AI in shaping the company’s future. Representatives from the AI R&D division provided a brief workshop on available AI platforms, APIs, and cloud-based tools that could be leveraged during the competition.

Teams then spent the early hours brainstorming solutions, defining their project scopes, and assigning roles.

Afternoon Session: Development Sprint
Throughout the afternoon, teams worked intensively to build working prototypes. Some teams focused on integrating AI-driven chatbots for customer support, while others experimented with predictive analytics for personal finance recommendations. A few groups tackled internal efficiency challenges, such as using AI-based document summarization for finance reports or automation of QA processes for software testing.

Evening Session: Demos and Judging
In the evening, each team had five minutes to present their solution to a judging panel consisting of senior engineers, product managers, and AI experts. The judging criteria included:

Innovation: originality of the concept.

Practicality: potential for real-world implementation.

Technical Execution: quality of the prototype and effective use of AI tools.

Impact: potential improvement in product value or work efficiency.

Highlights and Standout Projects
While every team showcased creativity, several projects stood out:

AI-Powered Expense Categorization
One team developed a machine learning model capable of automatically categorizing financial transactions with high accuracy, significantly reducing manual classification tasks for users.

Automated Meeting Summarizer
Another team created an AI service that integrates with online meeting platforms and generates concise, actionable meeting summaries using natural language processing (NLP). This solution addressed internal workflow efficiency and drew enthusiastic responses from judges.

Personalized Financial Advice Chatbot
A group explored the integration of generative AI models to provide personalized financial advice in a conversational interface. The chatbot could answer user questions and suggest budgeting strategies based on financial patterns.

AI-based Bug Detection for Code Repositories
One ambitious team built an AI assistant capable of scanning code repositories, identifying potential bugs, and suggesting fixes, aiming to enhance the productivity of MoneyForward’s development teams.
